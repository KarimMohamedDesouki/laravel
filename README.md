# Laravel CRUD Operations Labs at ITI

Welcome to the Laravel CRUD Operations Labs repository for your ITI course! This repository contains the solutions and resources for the Laravel labs focusing on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations conducted during your course.
In this repository, we focus on implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Laravel, a powerful PHP web framework. CRUD operations are essential in web development as they allow us to interact with data stored in a database. With Laravel, we utilize its expressive syntax and built-in features to streamline the implementation of CRUD functionality. We demonstrate how to create new records, retrieve existing data, update records, and delete entries, all while leveraging Laravel's MVC architecture, eloquent ORM, routing system, form validation, and blade templating engine. Through these labs, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of how to build fully functional web applications with Laravel, from managing data persistence to presenting dynamic content to users.


## Introduction

Laravel is a powerful PHP web framework that simplifies web application development with its elegant syntax and rich set of features. CRUD operations are fundamental in web development, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete data from a database.

These labs are designed to help you understand how to implement CRUD operations in Laravel, covering topics such as routing, controllers, views, models, migrations, forms, validation, and database interactions.

## Installation

To get started with Laravel and CRUD operations on your Windows machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Composer**: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP that is used to install Laravel and its dependencies. You can download Composer from https://getcomposer.org/download/ and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Install PHP**: Laravel requires PHP installed on your machine. You can download PHP from https://windows.php.net/download/ and follow the installation instructions. Make sure to add the PHP executable to your system's PATH environment variable.

3. **Install Git**: Git is a version control system used for managing project files. You can download Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win and follow the installation instructions.

4. **Install Laravel Installer**: Laravel provides a command-line tool called Laravel Installer, which simplifies the process of creating new Laravel projects. You can install it globally using Composer:

**composer global require laravel/installer**


5. **Create a New Laravel Project**: Once Laravel Installer is installed, you can create a new Laravel project using the following command:

**laravel new project-name**


6. **Configure Environment**: Configure your database connection settings in the .env file located at the root of your Laravel project. You'll need to set up your database credentials (database name, username, password).

7. **Run Migration**: Laravel's migration feature allows you to manage your database schema using PHP code. Run the following command to run all of your outstanding migrations:

**php artisan migrate**


**Now you're ready to start working on CRUD operations in Laravel!**
